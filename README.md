# About

This project consists of an action suggestion engine for turn-based games.

It currently implements the following games:
- Tic-tac-toe;
- Chess:
  - It does not implement the threefold repetition rule. However, it implements the 50-move draw rule, which is enough to prevent infinite games.

For action suggestion, it currently implements the following engines:
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS);
- AlphaZero (more information in its README)

Note: although theoretically useful, MCTS is not usable with the current implementation of chess, as it would take several hours to suggest one good move.

To start the copilot run `python main.py`. The provided inputs are stored in a `history.txt` file at the root. A compiled version of the project can be generated with `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` for some performance improvement. However it does not work with AlphaZero, since PyTorch doesn't fully implement proper type annotations. To clean the files generated by the previous command, run `python clean.py`.
